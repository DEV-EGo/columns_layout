        <h2>Iphone vs Android</h2>

        <p>
          A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away the battle between iPhone
          and Android devices began. Seemingly at the beginning of time. In
          other words, 2008.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost a dozen years ago! Like all great battles, people have chosen
          sides, they’ve stood their ground, they’ll fight to prove their phone
          is best.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the release of our Android version of TaxBird (cough, cough, tell
          your friends, cough), we thought it would be interesting to take a
          deeper look at iPhone and Android to see which reigns supreme.

            <h3>iOS</h3>

            <ol>
              <ul>
                iOS is a more secure operating system
              </ul>
              <ul>
                Android has a fragmented OS which makes the development harder.
              </ul>
              <ul>
                As iOS is consistent across all Apple devices and easier to
                update whenever a new update is released, iOS is better than
                Android in this aspect
              </ul>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <!-- column 2 -->

          <div class="column">
            <h3>Android</h3>
            <ol>
              <ul>
                Android beats iOS because it provides more flexibility,
                functionality, and freedom of choice
              </ul>
              <ul>
                Android has an 86.7% share of the global mobile market versus a
                13.3% share by iOS.
              </ul>
              <ul>
                Android’s win simply because the iPhone does not allow upgrading
                the storage space.
              </ul>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div class="column">
            <h3>Similarities!</h3>
            <ol>
              <ul>
                Both the iOS and Android phones have calling, messaging, web
                browsing, video chat, maps, voice commands etc
              </ul>
              <ul>
                Privacy settings are paramount in both iOS and Android. Users
                are presented with app permissions as this lessens the risk of
                data leakage.
              </ul>
              <ul>
                4G cellular network can be enjoyed on both the iOS and Android
                devices. This is very important as cellular network is crucial
                for internet surfing.
